# forkify Project

This is a final project from JavaScript course by Jonas Schmedtmann. 

It was a huge step in my learning process. My approach to organize application architecture and project planning improves significantly. I have learnt what is a Model-view-controller software design pattern and how it works, how to write a documentation, how important is to write DRY code and codes which is readable for other developers.
